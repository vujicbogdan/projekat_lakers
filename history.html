                    <p>The Lakers advanced to the NBA finals six times in the 1960s but lost to the Celtics in each
                        appearance despite the presence of all-time greats Elgin Baylor and Jerry West</p>

                    <h2>1970s</h2>
                    <p>During the 1971–72 season, however, the Lakers—led by West, Gail Goodrich, and Wilt
                        Chamberlain—set NBA records for longest winning streak (33 games) and best regular season record
                        on their way to the NBA championship, the team’s first title since relocating to Los Angeles.
                        The Lakers again reached the finals in 1972–73 but lost to the New York Knicks. After that
                        season Chamberlain retired, and the team’s fortunes took a turn for the worse as the Lakers
                        missed the playoffs in consecutive seasons for the first time in franchise history in 1974–75
                        and 1975–76.

                    <h2>1980s</h2>
                    <p>The Lakers entered the most dominant period in their franchise history when they selected Magic
                        Johnson in the first overall pick of the 1979 NBA draft. Johnson teamed with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
                        and (from 1982) James Worthy to take the Lakers to eight appearances in the NBA finals over the
                        following decade, resulting in five NBA championships (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, and
                        1988).Additionally, the renewed Lakers-Celtics rivalry—the two teams facing off for the NBA
                        title in 1984, 1985, and 1987 and, more specifically, Johnson’s battles with Boston’s Larry
                        Bird—propelled the NBA to new levels of popularity in the 1980s.</p>

                    <h2>1990s</h2>
                    <p>After Abdul-Jabbar’s retirement in 1989 and Johnson’s in 1991, the Lakers’ fortunes took a turn
                        for the worse. The team still regularly made the playoffs—the Lakers missed postseason play only
                        five times in the team’s first 60 seasons—but failed to advance to the NBA finals for the
                        longest period of time in team history.</p>

                    <h2>2000s</h2>
                    <p>That changed during the 1999–2000 season, however, when newly hired head coach Phil Jackson
                        guided the Lakers, featuring Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant, to the first of three consecutive
                        titles. O’Neal was traded away in 2004, but a reconfigured Laker team with Bryant as the focal
                        point advanced to the 2008 NBA finals, which they lost to Boston in six games. The Lakers
                        returned to the finals the following season, where they routed the Orlando Magic in five games
                        to capture the franchise’s 15th championship. In the 2009–10 season the Lakers made their third
                        consecutive finals appearance, where they defeated the Celtics in a dramatic seven-game series.

                    <h2>2010s</h2>
                    <p>The Lakers then entered a period of a relative lack of success, which reached its nadir in
                        2012–13. The team added perennial All-Stars Steve Nash and Dwight Howard in the preseason and
                        was considered one of the favourites to win the championship, but it muddled through an
                        inconsistent and injury-plagued campaign that ended with the team’s being swept out of the
                        playoffs in the first round. Howard left in free agency in the off-season, and Bryant and Nash
                        both missed most of the next season with injuries, which greatly contributed to the Lakers’
                        posting a losing record in 2013–14. Bryant missed much of the following season with another
                        injury, and the Lakers struggled to a 21–61 record. The team was even worse in 2015–16, going a
                        franchise-worst 17–65 in Bryant’s final season before his retirement.
                        The team’s record improved by nine wins in 2016–17, but the extension of the Lakers’
                        franchise-record playoff drought to four seasons led to a front-office shake-up, which included
                        Magic Johnson’s taking over as the team’s president of basketball operations.</p>

                    <h2>King James ERA</h2>
                    <p>Johnson helped lure superstar free agent LeBron James to the Lakers during the 2018 off-season,
                        but the team failed to significantly improve, and Johnson abruptly resigned at the end of the
                        2018–19 season. The following season was tumultuous. In January 2020 Bryant was among those
                        killed in a helicopter crash, and less than two months later the NBA suspended play due to the
                        COVID-19 pandemic. In July the season resumed but with a shortened schedule and the players
                        largely isolated in a “bubble.” Backed by the stellar play of James, who was named the finals
                        MVP, the Lakers ultimately defeated the Miami Heat to win the NBA championship.</p>
